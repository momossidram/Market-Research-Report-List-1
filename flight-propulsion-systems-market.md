<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flight Propulsion Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Breathing Engines</li><li>Non-Air Breathing Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flight propulsion systems can be categorized into air-breathing and non-air-breathing engines. Air-breathing engines, such as turbojets and turbofans, utilize atmospheric oxygen for combustion, making them suitable for subsonic and supersonic flight. In contrast, non-air-breathing engines, like rockets, carry both fuel and an oxidizer, enabling operation in space where atmospheric air is unavailable. This distinction highlights their applications: air-breathing engines excel in atmospheric flight, while non-air-breathing engines are essential for space exploration and high-altitude use.</p></p>
