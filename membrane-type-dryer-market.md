<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Type Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The membrane type dryer market is divided into two primary categories: porous and non-porous membranes. Porous membranes facilitate gas separation through tiny pores, allowing specific gases to pass while retaining others, making them effective for applications like dehydration and filtration. In contrast, non-porous membranes function by creating a barrier that only allows certain gases or vapors to permeate based on size or affinity, often used in more selective separation processes. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
