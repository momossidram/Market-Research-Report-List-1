<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Rotary Encoders</li><li>Absolute Rotary Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary encoder market is primarily divided into two types: incremental and absolute rotary encoders. Incremental rotary encoders detect changes in position through motion, providing relative position information and often requiring a reference point for accurate tracking. Conversely, absolute rotary encoders provide a unique position value for each shaft angle, maintaining position data even when power is lost. Both types are widely used in automation, robotics, and industrial applications for precise motion control and feedback.</p></p>
