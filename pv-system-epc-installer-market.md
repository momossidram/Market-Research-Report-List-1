<p><strong>The PV System EPC Installer Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid</li><li>Off-grid/On-grid</li><li>On-grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PV system EPC installer market encompasses three primary applications: off-grid, off-grid/on-grid, and on-grid systems. Off-grid installations provide electricity independently from the utility grid, ideal for remote locations. Off-grid/on-grid systems allow for both independence and utility connection, enabling users to sell excess energy back to the grid. On-grid systems are directly connected to the utility grid, optimizing energy consumption and reducing costs through net metering. Each application caters to varying energy needs and enhances solar adoption based on local conditions.</p></p>
