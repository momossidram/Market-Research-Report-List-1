<p><strong>Plasma TVs Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The Plasma TVs market has seen a significant transformation with the shift toward OLED and LCD technologies, leading to a decline in plasma TV production. However, several key players still play a role in this dwindling segment, including Samsung, Panasonic, LG, and Sony.</p><p>**Samsung** has historically dominated the TV market with advanced technologies and innovative features. While they have transitioned towards QLED and microLED, their strong brand presence maintains a loyal customer base. Samsung's 2023 revenue from its visual display segment was approximately $22 billion, reflecting its broad market reach beyond plasma technologies.</p><p>**Panasonic** was a major player in the plasma TV market, known for its high-quality screens. Although they ceased plasma production in 2014, Panasonic still benefits from its legacy through a loyal clientele and continues to invest in display technologies, targeting growth in OLED and other advanced displays.</p><p>**LG** is also a frontrunner in display technologies, focusing on OLED. They were once a major contributor to the plasma market, but their pivot towards OLEDs has been successful. In 2023, LG reported TV sales revenue of around $15 billion, capitalizing on innovative display solutions and expanding their market share.</p><p>**Sony**, while not as prominently associated with plasma TVs, continues to influence the broader television market with high-resolution displays and premium technology. Their revenue in the electronics segment surpassed $20 billion in 2023, benefiting from a diverse product lineup that includes OLED TVs.</p><p>Overall, while plasma TVs are declining, companies like LG, Samsung, and Sony are adapting by enhancing their portfolios with next-gen technologies. The global TV market is projected to grow steadily, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5% due to ongoing innovations in display technology and increased demand for smart TVs.</p></p>

<p><strong>What Are The Key Opportunities For Plasma TVs Manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p><p>The Plasma TV market has experienced a significant decline since its peak around 2010, primarily due to the rise of LCD, LED, and OLED technologies that offer superior picture quality, energy efficiency, and thinner profiles. Despite their impressive color accuracy and viewing angles, Plasma TVs have become niche products, dominating only 2-3% of the flat-screen TV market by 2023. Future growth is unlikely, as manufacturers have largely phased out production. Market outlook suggests that Plasma technology will continue to fade, with sustainability and smart features driving innovations in alternative technologies, leading to increased consumer preference for OLED and QLED displays.</p></p>
